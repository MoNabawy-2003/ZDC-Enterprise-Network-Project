# ZDC-Enterprise-Network-Project
ZDC is a medium-sized enterprise with two wired buildings using a 3-Tier Architecture (Core, Distribution, Access) and one wireless building for mobile devices and IoT. All facilities are linked to a centralized Data Center via high-speed connections, and the network accesses the internet through a border router with advanced protocols.
